# Yia's Individual Project

### Problem Statement
Today's traveling application is limited to finding and book a flight, hotel, finding restaurants, or getting directions
and does not retain the history of where we've been and the experience we had. Our current traveling tracking 
application allows for manual entries to track the places we been which is outdated and inefficient in today fast past 
world. With the ease of traveling nowadays, we seek a way to automatically track the places we've been and allow us to 
revisit the memories we made.
